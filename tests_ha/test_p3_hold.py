"""P3 holds the overnight dryback at its target, in a real Home Assistant with the real controller.

P3 used to water only below the rescue level, so a night that dried faster than the day went on past
the dryback target to the rescue level. Now a zone that dries to the day's peak less its P3 dryback
target gets a shot the size of its rescue shot. Everything it uses is the room's own: the steering
mode's dryback target, the rescue shot size and P2's time between shots, read from the integration's
numbers, and what it publishes (the zone's next condition and its label) lands in Home Assistant.
