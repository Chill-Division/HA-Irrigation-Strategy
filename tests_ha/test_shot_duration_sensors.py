"""The P1, P2 and P3 shot-duration sensors give the seconds the controller runs each shot for.

Before, they divided a room-wide shot by ONE dripper's flow: a room with two drippers per plant
read double, and a zone sized on its own in Rooms & hardware read the room's numbers. Here the
REAL sensors, in a real Home Assistant, are held against the REAL controller's own arithmetic on
the same states: its substrate litres, its flow, its shot size and its room limit.
