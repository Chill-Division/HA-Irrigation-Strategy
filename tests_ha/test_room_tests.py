"""Settings → Rooms & hardware → Tests, in a real Home Assistant with the real controller.

Each zone has a Test Shot button on its own device, named for its room; the dashboard's test shot
presses it through the integration's test_shot service, and the controller waters that zone for 10
seconds at its next pass, a test shot and not one of the day's shots. The test refill is feed_mix;
with "Run anyway" (force) the feed plan sensor says so before the press, and the controller then starts
a refill it would refuse as one that could overflow the reservoir.
