"""A saved change to a room's setup is recorded where Home Assistant keeps who changed what: its
logbook (the Activity panel, and the room's device page), with the person who saved it, and its
log at INFO. A refused change records nothing: nothing changed, and its reason is the refusal.

The integration fires the logbook's own event, and these read the entries back through the real
recorder and the real logbook, as the Activity panel does."""
