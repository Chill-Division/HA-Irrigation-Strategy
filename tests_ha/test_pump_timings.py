"""The pump's prime and the main line's lead are room settings, in a real Home Assistant with the
real controller. They were fixed at 2 s and 1 s: a pump that takes 4 s to reach pressure opened
every zone valve onto a line still filling. A new room and an upgraded one have them at 2 s and
1 s, so nothing changes until they are set; set, the controller waits them; under an integration
older than them, it keeps waiting 2 s and 1 s.
