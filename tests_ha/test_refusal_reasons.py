"""A change Home Assistant refuses says why, on the page where it was made.

The dashboard calls the integration's room services (setup_*, strategy_*, runs_*, stock_*, feed_*)
inside Home Assistant over its websocket, the way Home Assistant's own frontend calls a service. It
used to call them over REST, where Home Assistant answers every refusal with a bare "500 Internal
Server Error" and the reason reaches only its log: renaming a room while it was watering said
"Response error: 500" and nothing more. These run Home Assistant's real web server and websocket,
and read what the dashboard reads (frontend/src/lib/client.ts): `result.response` when the service
answered, `error.message` when it refused.
