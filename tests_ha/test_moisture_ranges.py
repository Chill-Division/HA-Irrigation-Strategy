"""The engine never clips a moisture level its Home Assistant setting accepts.

CS-401 told the owner that a peak VWC target of 87 was outside the engine's range and used 85,
although the setting had taken it: the setting accepted 5-95 and the engine 20-85. Each of the four
moisture levels now has one range, the same in the setting, the engine, grow plans and Auto
Setpoints. The tops are 100, because the order between the levels is what bounds the water; the
floors, where the engine always had them, catch a slipped digit.
