"""The hardware fault (CS-301) names the switch that did not read OFF, and how.

It used to say "zone 1 valve/pump/mainline close not confirmed": the operator had to search the
history of three switches for the one that stayed on. Now the fault keeps each switch that failed
and why (still ON, unavailable, unknown, unreadable, or Home Assistant refused to switch it off),
and says so in its notification, in the zone's status and in the heartbeat the dashboard shows.
A fault saved by an older controller, with only its reason, still loads and still holds.
