# Changelog

All notable changes to PHASE Control (Crop Steering before 1.0.2, PHASE Steering in 1.0.2) will be
documented in this file.

**Two views per release.** Each version leads with what changed and why it matters, written so
anyone can follow it without knowing the internals, followed by **🔧 Technical notes**, the entity-
and code-level detail for developers and AI agents working on the repo.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- **No more `via_device` warnings in Home Assistant's log.** From Home Assistant 2026.9 it warned that
  the way the zones are put under their room stops working in 2027.8; they now use the way it asks.
- **A hardware fault says which switch.** When a pump or valve doesn't switch off after a shot, the
  Overview and Home Assistant's notification now name it and say what it read (still on, or
  unavailable), with its code, CS-301, in one card instead of three. While it holds the room, every
  zone reads "Blocked: hardware fault (CS-301)" instead of its phase, such as "Optimal".
- **The Schedule page explains how it works with Today.** It shows how a schedule and Today's targets
  take turns and which one is in charge, and Today says when a schedule is armed or running.
- **Export and import Today's targets.** Save a room's targets to a file, both steering modes at
  once, to load into another room or send to someone; nothing changes until the draft is reviewed.

### 🔧 Technical notes

- Integration: the zones' `DeviceInfo` no longer passes `via_device`, deprecated in Home Assistant
  2026.9 and removed in 2027.8.0. `_link_zone_devices` sets each zone device's `via_device_id` to its
  room's device once the platforms are set up, which works on every supported Home Assistant
  (2026.5 on); a zone an older version linked is left as it is. Proven in
  `tests_ha/test_zone_devices_under_the_room.py` on a fresh install and a seeded old one (2026.5 and
  2026.9), where the old code logged the warning.
- Controller: `_close_failures` and `_switch_off_failures` keep each switch that did not read OFF
  after a close and how (`CLOSE_FAILURES`: Home Assistant refused, still ON, unavailable, unknown,
  unreadable, or OFF only after the read-back gave up). The hardware fault keeps them (`switches`,
  saved in `/data/state.json`; a fault saved before has none, and still loads and holds). The CS-301
  notification leads with them, and `_hardware_fault_block`, the heartbeat's `hardware_fault` and the
  zone's status, reads "hardware fault (CS-301): zone 1 shot end: Pump (switch.pump) still read ON
  6 s after it was switched off", without the internal room name, an entity id to switch or "re-arm".
  The hold, what clears it and the 6 s read-back are as before. Each zone's status
  (`zone_N_status_app`) says "Blocked: hardware fault (CS-301)" for as long as the fault holds the
  room (`_hardware_fault_short`), not only in a pass where the zone wanted water: it used to read its
  phase ("Optimal" in P2) the rest of the time.
- Dashboard: the room's card is "Watering stopped: a pump or valve didn't switch off (CS-301)" with
  the controller's words (`hardwareFaultWords`, which also tidies an older controller's), and a zone
  blocked by it raises no second card. Every zone of a held room reads "Blocked: hardware fault
  (CS-301)", whatever its phase, and a code in a zone's status never breaks at its hyphen. The
  CS-301 entry in the error codes says the alert names the switch.
- Tests: `addons/f2_control/tests/test_hardware_fault_names.py`,
  `tests_ha/test_hardware_fault_names_the_switch.py` (2026.5 and 2026.9) and `room-status.test.ts`.
  The controller tests' fake Home Assistant keeps a switch's attributes when it switches, as Home
  Assistant does.
- Dashboard: `lib/schedule-words.ts` says, from `strategy.py` and `strategy_runtime.py`, what each
  schedule status means: Not armed, Armed, Running, Disarming, Held. Schedule's status card says
  it, with when an arm or disarm takes effect (`armed_after`, `disarm_after`), above four steps
  with the current one marked and "What takes priority"; its arm and disarm dialogs and notices
  name Today's targets instead of "legacy setpoints". Today's description and note follow the
  schedule's status. The demo publishes its schedule's status as
  `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>strategy_plan`, as the integration does. Nothing changes in how the
  integration or the controller runs a schedule.
- Dashboard: `lib/targets-file.ts`, format `phase-control-targets` version 1. It holds the room's
  settings and each zone's by setting key and zone number, so a file fits a room with another
  prefix, and each steering mode. Pot size, plants and drippers are never written; lights hours,
  the pump and main-line timings and the room's longest shot are written but never loaded. A value
  off a setting's step is rounded to the nearest it takes and one outside its limits is skipped,
  both said. Import only fills Today's draft and waits while one is open; neither button works
  while a schedule is engaged. Tests: `targets-file.test.ts` and the dashboard browser check.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-10-09

Integration and controller **1.0.3**.

- **PHASE Steering is now PHASE Control**, and its app PHASE Controller: PHASE already stands for
  Precision Hydration And Steering Engine, so the name no longer says steering twice. Help says
  what PHASE stands for.
- **The project's address is now github.com/Chill-Division/PHASE-Control.** The old addresses keep
  working, so a Home Assistant that already has one needs no change: leave it as it is.

### 🔧 Technical notes

- Names only. `const.PRODUCT_NAME` is PHASE Control: the sidebar entry, the room's device, the
  zones' entity names, the setup wizard's default name, `manifest.json` and `hacs.json`. The app
  is PHASE Controller, its panel and `repository.yaml` PHASE Control. The menu reads PHASE Control
  over "Crop steering", and Help → Terms & phases opens with PHASE. The setup and Repairs texts,
  the error codes, the alerts, the docs and the logos say the same. No entity id, the domain, the
  `f2_control` slug, the app's options and `/data` or the file formats change. Home Assistant
  renames the device and the entities' default names in place, from Crop Steering or from 1.0.2's
  PHASE Steering, and keeps any name the operator gave (`tests_ha/test_product_name.py`).
- The controller leaves a room still at the wizard's default name out of alerts, whichever release
  set it up: `DEFAULT_ROOM_NAMES` adds "phase control" and keeps "phase steering".
- Both repositories were renamed on 2026-10-09, from `HA-Irrigation-Strategy` to `PHASE-Steering`
  and the same day to `PHASE-Control` (`Chill-Division/…` and `ChillingSilence/…`). GitHub redirects
  every old address for the web, its API and git. HACS records a rename itself
  (`renamed_repositories` in its source), and the Supervisor's `git ls-remote` and `git fetch`
  follow the redirect. The Supervisor names the app after the address it was added from:
  `f50c47e4_f2_control` (HA-Irrigation-Strategy), `f99c52b1_f2_control` (PHASE-Steering),
  `4cddaccb_f2_control` (PHASE-Control). Swapping one address for another is a move
  ([INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)), not an update. No repository may ever take an old name.
- Links: `manifest.json` (documentation, issue tracker), the Repairs cards' Learn more
  (`const.REPAIRS_DOCS_URL`), What's new's release notes, the app's `config.yaml`, `repository.yaml`
  and DOCS.md, the README's links, badges and pictures, the docs, and `release.py`'s `PUBLIC`.
  `tests/test_repository_links.py` keeps every link on the current name.
- 1.0.3 was first released with only the links to PHASE-Steering. It was withdrawn the same day
  and this release took its number ([RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md), Versions). A box that took
  that first 1.0.3 is offered nothing for this one: Redownload in HACS and Rebuild the app.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-09

Integration and controller **1.0.2**.

- **Crop Steering is now PHASE Steering**, short for Precision Hydration And Steering Engine, with
  a new icon: the day's four phases around a drop of water. Nothing else changes: your rooms,
  settings, strategies, history and automations carry on as they were.

### 🔧 Technical notes

- Names only. The integration (`manifest.json`, `hacs.json`), its sidebar entry (now
  `mdi:water-circle`), the room's device, the zones' entity names (`PHASE Steering Zone N …`), the
  setup wizard's default name, the setup and Repairs texts, the error codes, the dashboard, the
  controller app (`PHASE Steering Controller`, its panel and `repository.yaml`) and the brand images.
  The integration keeps the name in one place, `const.PRODUCT_NAME`.
- Unchanged: the `crop_steering` domain, every entity id, the `f2_control` slug and the app's
  options and `/data`, the sidebar's address, the strategy and feed recipe file formats and the
  repository's address.
- The room's device had two names, "Crop Steering System" from the sensors and "Crop Steering" from
  the other platforms, whichever registered last; it has one, PHASE Steering. Home Assistant renames
  the device and the entities' default names in place, and keeps any name the operator gave either.
  From 2026.9 Home Assistant shows the device's name in front of each entity's, so a room's entities
  read "PHASE Steering …" there.
- Controller: the vitals notifications are titled "PHASE Steering vitals" where the app's
  "Name in notifications" option was never changed. A room left at the wizard's default name
  (PHASE Steering, or Crop Steering System before) is still left out of alerts
  (`DEFAULT_ROOM_NAMES`).
- Tests: `tests_ha/test_product_name.py` (a fresh install, and a seeded old install updated in
  place: the device and names follow, no id moves, the operator's device name stays) and a real
  wizard left at its default name in `tests_ha/test_alerts_name_the_zone.py`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-08

Integration and controller **1.0.1**.

- **Unified naming of Irrigation Strategy and Feed Recipes.**
- **Feed EC now set per-recipe** to allow for steering at lower EC rootzones, defaults to 3.0EC
  where not set.
- Bug fixes and improvements.

### 🔧 Technical notes

- Docs: `docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md`, linked first in the README's Documentation and from the user guide.
  Every rule in it is the one the engine, the controller or Auto setpoints applies, and its pictures
  are the README's own screenshots.
- Release: `scripts/release.py --sync` fast-forwards the public `main` to `main` here once Validate
  has passed on it, with no version, tag or release. `sync_refusal` refuses when the commits since
  touch `custom_components/` or `addons/f2_control/`: the Supervisor builds the app from the public
  `main`, so they would reach every box that installs or rebuilds it under the last released
  number. `docs/RELEASING.md` (Commits that ship nothing) and CLAUDE.md say when to use it.
  The app's changelog, documentation and pictures and the controller's tests go too
  (`SHOWN_ONLY`): the Supervisor only shows them, and none is built into the image.
- Docs: stale references removed across `docs/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the engine's README and the
  app's `DOCS.md`, each checked against the code. `docs/ENTITIES.md` gains the room prefix, an
  Engine ranges table (the `validate_params` bounds narrower than the entities') and corrected
  rows for `maximum_ec`, `field_capacity`, EC stacking, the steering selects, the display-only EC
  sensors, `app_status`, `ai_heartbeat`, the safety sensors and the manual override.
  `docs/RELEASING.md` says the 2.x numbers can be used again.
- Text only, no change to watering: `docs/error-codes.json` (CS-206, CS-401, CS-601, CS-606,
  CS-608) and `docs/ERROR_CODES.md` from it; the CS-206 and CS-401 notifications in
  `controller.py`; the CS-606 Repairs card (`strings.json`, `translations/en.json`); the Maximum EC
  help and the Reservoir's not-reported note on the dashboard; comments and docstrings in the
  engine (both copies), the controller, `health.py`, `strategy.py` and `room.py`; the app's
  `num_zones` and `enable_flag` option texts (`addons/f2_control/translations/en.yaml`); and the
  `whats_new_seen` example version in `services.yaml`.
- Integration: `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>p1/p2/p3_shot_duration_seconds` time the configured
  shot in each active zone from the zone's own `substrate_volume`, `drippers_per_plant` and
  `dripper_flow_rate` (the room's where the zone has none), then whole seconds, at least
  `MIN_SHOT_S` and at most `max_shot_duration`, as `_act_zone` does. The state is the longest
  zone's, attribute `zones` each zone's, and unknown when no zone's sizing gives a flow (it used to
  read 0). `ShotCalculator.calculate_shot_duration` takes `drippers_per_plant`;
  `capped_shot_seconds` is new. `tests_ha/test_shot_duration_sensors.py` holds the real sensors
  against the real controller's arithmetic.
- Feed EC: `feed.clean` keeps a recipe's optional `ec` (mS/cm, 0.1 to 10; none, empty or 0 is
  none; a stored recipe without it loads with none) and `feed.plan` publishes the stage in use's
  as `feed_ec` on `sensor.crop_steering_<prefix>feed_plan`. The controller's `feed_plan()` reads it
  (anything not a number from 0.1 to 10 is none) and `_snapshot` passes it as
  `ZoneSnapshot.feed_ec`, which every flush and dilution test in `decide()` compares pore EC with;
  without it the engine's default stays 3.0. The dashboard's recipe card has the field, recipe
  files carry `ec` (a file without it imports with none), and CS-206 says where the feed's EC comes
  from. `tests_ha/test_feed_batches.py` takes a recipe's EC from the real `feed_save` to the real
  controller's snapshot.
- Wording: "irrigation strategy" (or "strategy") replaces "grow plan", "plan" and the irrigation
  "recipe" in the dashboard, the integration's Repairs cards (CS-606, CS-607), `services.yaml`,
  `setup_api`'s zone-change refusal, `strategy_model`'s zone check, the strategy sensor's friendly
  name (Irrigation strategy), `select.crop_steering_<prefix>recipe_stage`'s name (Strategy Stage),
  `docs/error-codes.json` and the docs. Nothing a box or an automation reads moves: entity ids,
  service ids and fields, the `#/strategy` and `#/grow-plan` addresses, the library's storage key
  and the export format (`crop-steering-plan`) stay; exported files are now named
  `crop-steering-strategy-….json`. The controller's Auto setpoints frozen reason names an armed
  irrigation strategy. The browser checks and unit tests follow the new labels.
- Dashboard: a feed recipe card's "In use" pill, export and remove buttons are one group
  (`.res-recipe-actions`), the header grid's last column; on a phone they take a row of their own.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-05

Integration and controller **1.0.0**.

- **Version 1.0, for everyone.** The first release published at
  github.com/Chill-Division/HA-Irrigation-Strategy, where HACS and Settings → Apps install it from.
  The numbers start again: 1.0.0 follows 2.37.1. On a box already running 2.37, the Supervisor
  offers the controller app as usual, but HACS offers no lower number: redownload Crop Steering in
  HACS and pick 1.0.0. What's new then shows what's new in 1.0.
- **Credits and licences.** The README credits JakeTheRabbit's HA-Irrigation-Strategy, where Crop
  Steering began, and the licence names him and Chill Division. Every part a box installs carries
  the licence, and the dashboard ships its open-source libraries' licences beside it.
- **The README shows the public repository's pictures.** Its screenshots and its link to the rest
  come from github.com/Chill-Division/HA-Irrigation-Strategy, like its other links.
- **Fresh screenshots.** The README and the screenshots page show this release, the new icon
  included.
- **No What's new with the first-run tour.** Someone shown round the dashboard for the first time
  is not also shown what changed in it. The two met only where a room was set up again on a box
  that had run an older release.
- **A new icon.** A tank of water with a seedling in front of it, white on the same blue tile: in
  the dashboard's menu, on Home Assistant's integrations page, in HACS, and for the controller app
  in Settings → Apps. The logo beside it says Crop Steering in the tile's blue, which reads on a
  light theme and a dark one.
- **Steadier accessibility checks.** The checks that read the dashboard's contrast in the dark
  theme no longer fail now and then on text that was still turning light. They wait until nothing
  on the page is changing colour, so what they measure is what a grower sees.

### 🔧 Technical notes

- Licence: `LICENSE` names JakeTheRabbit and, under him, Chill Division. Copies ship in
  `custom_components/crop_steering/` (HACS installs only that folder, and the release zip holds
  only it), `addons/f2_control/` (the Dockerfile copies it into the app's image) and
  `crop-steering-engine/`. The dashboard build writes `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`: every npm package
  in the build's module graph, and Tailwind, sorted and undated (`frontend/vite.config.ts`).
  `package.mjs` ships it beside both copies of the dashboard, and `tests/test_licence.py` holds
  all of it.
- Docs: the README's six image addresses (raw.githubusercontent.com) and its screenshots link move
  from `ChillingSilence` to `Chill-Division`, where its other links already went. They stay
  absolute, so HACS, which shows the README, shows the pictures too (`docs/SCREENSHOTS.md`).
- Docs: the twelve `img/` screenshots that show the menu or the time of day are retaken by the
  browser checks that write them, at 2:35 PM in the demo (`TZ=Asia/Dubai`), as the last set was
  taken in the afternoon. `docs/SCREENSHOTS.md` says to take them while the day is under way.
- Dashboard: `WhatsNewOnUpdate` marks the installed release seen and opens no window when it starts
  the first-run tour (`whats_new_get`'s `tour`), as its comment already said it did. The
  verify-dashboard tour check opens the demo as a new installation whose record is behind
  (`?tour=new&whats-new=2.22.0`): the tour, and no What's new, which the bundle before this opened
  too.
- Release: `scripts/release.py --start-again` releases a number below the last one, never one the
  changelog already has (`check_number`). It leaves `WHATS_NEW.md` with only the sections numbered
  up to the new release (`drop_numbered_above`), since the dashboard orders releases by number; the
  changelogs keep everything. `test_version_consistency` now holds every release to one number for
  the pair: it skipped anything below 2.21.0, which 1.x would have been. Integration:
  `WhatsNew.async_init` reads a record numbered above the installed release as unknown, so a box
  that last showed 2.37.1 shows the last 30 days of releases up to 1.0.0 and marks it. The
  real-HA What's new tests number their earlier releases 0.x, under every real one.
- Dashboard, integration and app: `BrandGlyph` (`frontend/src/components/brand-glyph.tsx`)
  replaces the menu's droplets. Its seedling is drawn twice, first wide in the tile's colour
  (`.brand-glyph-halo`), so the tank's lines stop short of it. A new script,
  `frontend/scripts/make-brand-images.mjs` (run after `npm run build`), draws the integration's
  `brand/` images and the app's `icon.png` and `logo.png` from the built dashboard's own mark, in
  its light theme's colours and font. It replaces `scripts/make_brand_images.py` and that
  script's 2.2 MB source picture, `img/crop-steering-logo.png`. The `dark_` images are gone: Home
  Assistant serves the light ones in their place, which `tests_ha/test_brand_images.py` proves
  through its web server.
- Tests: `settled` (`frontend/scripts/settled.mjs`) waits until no finite animation or transition
  is running (at most 5 s), then two frames, and every axe audit in the browser checks calls it
  first. At reduced motion every element eases every property for 0.01 ms, and an element added
  while its parent's colour is still changing starts its own change only when the parent's ends,
  so after the theme flips a colour reaches nested text one level a frame: the strategy page's
  headings took about twelve frames on a CPU slowed sixfold. The two-frame wait read them still
  dark on dark (#212121 on #1c1c1c, 1.05:1) in "setting explainer, dark", which failed pull
  requests #58 and #139. With the race forced, the old wait failed 6 runs of 6 and `settled`
  none. It replaces `verify-workspace`'s own one-pass `settle` and `light-shot.mjs`'s `settled`.
