"""next_shot_size: the size of a zone's next routine shot, as decide() would size it now.

The controller adds up a room's next round of shots to refill its reservoir before it runs short: in
the middle of a P1 ramp the next shot is bigger than the last, and once the ramp is done the next
one is P2's. Each size here is checked against the shot decide() actually fires."""
