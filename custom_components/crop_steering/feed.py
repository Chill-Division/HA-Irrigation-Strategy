"""Nutrient batches: a room's reservoir, its dosers, and a feed recipe for each growth stage.

Pure, no Home Assistant, so the rules are testable on their own (feed_api.py stores and serves them).

A batch refills the room's reservoir with fresh water for a set time, and half-way through starts the
pump through the recirculation line. A pause later, while the fresh water still runs, it doses each
doser the stage's recipe uses, in that recipe's order, one after the other a pause apart, and it
recirculates until the fresh water stops, and at least a little after the last dose.
The controller app runs it; this module says what it runs.

The reservoir's level: a distance sensor above the water reads further as it empties. Its distances
when full and when empty make that a percentage, as the controller works it out, and the reservoir
keeps at least the minimum: a refill comes before a shot that would take it lower. While nothing refills
it by itself (automatic refills off, or no refill switches mapped), the controller reminds a person to
refill it by hand from the reminder level, above the minimum (CS-706).

The amounts: a feed recipe gives each nutrient a number of parts, and the stage a strength in mL per
litre per part. The fill's litres scale them (what is left in the reservoir is already mixed): a doser
gives parts x strength x fill litres, to the whole mL (a doser gives no finer), and runs for that at
its flow (600 mL/min unless calibrated otherwise). Athena Flower at 3 : 5 : 1 : 0.5 and 1.667 mL/L per
part in 145 L is 725 mL Core, 1208 mL Bloom, 242 mL Balance and 121 mL Cleanse.

Each recipe has its own dosing order: a stage can use a doser the others leave out (Fade in place of
Core). A recipe saved before it had one takes the room's order, which this module kept until then.

Each recipe may also give its feed EC: what it mixes to, in mS/cm, as measured once mixed. The
controller takes the recipe in use's as the feed's EC when it judges whether a flush or a diluting
shot would bring the substrate's EC down; a recipe without one (and a room without a reservoir)
leaves it counting the feed as 3.0 mS/cm.

The stage in use: a feed schedule gives each week of the grow a recipe (Week 1 Vege, Weeks 2-6 Bloom,
Weeks 7-8 Fade), from the day its first week starts; after its last week, that week's recipe carries on.
A stage picked by hand while it runs holds until the schedule's next week starts. Without a schedule,
the stage is the one picked by hand.
