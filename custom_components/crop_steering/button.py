"""Buttons for PHASE Control: "Mix a Batch Now" for the room's reservoir, and a "Test Shot" for each
zone.

Pressing one does nothing here. Home Assistant records when it was pressed as the button's state, and
the controller app, which reads that, acts the next time it looks: Mix a Batch Now refills, mixes and
doses the reservoir (feed.py); a zone's Test Shot waters that zone for 10 seconds, to check that
watering works. Each is a request, not a command: the controller only acts while the room's watering
switch is on and nothing else is in the way, and says so if it cannot.
